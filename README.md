An 800 mm quadcopter flies an autonomous survey grid at 20–30 m, then revisits
only the coordinates it flagged at 3–5 m for close-up confirmation. Segmentation
runs on the aircraft, the orthomosaic builds on the field station, and no step of
the pipeline waits on connectivity.

This repository holds the project website.

## Running the site

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>. `npm run build` produces a fully static
export; both routes prerender.

**All copy lives in `lib/content.ts`.** Every claim, figure and spec there comes
from the presentation. The one exception is the demo advisory card, which is
invented sample data and labels itself `SAMPLE ALERT · ILLUSTRATIVE VALUES`
wherever it appears. The component-level BOM on the Feasibility section is a
marked placeholder.

Theme is [tweakcn](https://tweakcn.com) **nature**, light mode only — the dark
token block is deliberately removed. Type is Montserrat + Source Code Pro. The
AEGIS wordmark is drawn as SVG paths (`AEGIS_LETTERFORMS` in
`components/ui/bits.tsx`) rather than set in a typeface, and the same drawing is
reused on the drone's airframe.

Motion is decoration throughout: everything animated is disabled or reduced
under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
