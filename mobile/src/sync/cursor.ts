/**
 * Has the pod's database restarted since we last spoke to it?
 *
 * ── The failure this prevents ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The sync cursor is `seq` — the pod's SQLite rowid. It is monotonic, assigned
 * at commit, and never reused, which is exactly what makes it a safe cursor
 * while the database lives.
 *
 * **It restarts at 1 when that database is wiped or the device is reflashed.**
 *
 * The phone's cursor does not restart. So after a reflash the phone asks for
 * everything after seq 95, the pod's newest record is seq 3, and the manifest
 * comes back empty. Not an error — an empty list is a perfectly ordinary
 * answer meaning "nothing new". The sync reports success, fetches nothing, and
 * does so again on every subsequent attempt, forever. The farmer's history
 * silently stops growing and no screen anywhere says why.
 *
 * That is the worst shape a bug can take in this app: no crash, no error, no
 * symptom except an absence that looks exactly like a quiet week in the field.
 * On a build that gets reflashed as often as this one, it is a when, not an if.
 *
 * ── The detection ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `latest_seq` is the pod's own high-water mark. Under normal operation it only
 * ever grows, and it is always >= any cursor we could have got from it. Pruning
 * old advisories cannot lower it either, because pruning removes the oldest
 * records and `latest_seq` tracks the newest.
 *
 * So `latest_seq < cursor` has exactly one meaning: the numbering restarted.
 *
 * It also fires when the phone is pointed at a *different* pod that happens to
 * be further behind — which wants the same response, so that is a feature
 * rather than a false positive.
 *
 * ── Why rewinding is safe ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Ingest is an upsert keyed on `advisory_id`, and the manifest is filtered
 * against what the replica already holds. Re-pulling costs a few seconds and
 * changes nothing. Nothing is deleted from the phone: advisories the pod no
 * longer has are still the farmer's history, and they stay.

 * not hold is never offered again. The cursor may therefore only advance

 * "Just get the newest scan" stores seq 7 without walking the manifest. The
 * old rule jumped to the highest seq the phone held, so the next full pull
 * asked for `since=7` and seqs 1–6 were never pulled. The same rule let one
 * failed fetch of seq 1 save a cursor of 7, because 7 was already held. Both
