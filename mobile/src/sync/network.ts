/**
 * The platform boundary. Everything platform-specific about reaching a WiFi
 * network that has no internet lives in this one file, so that when the native
 * module lands, nothing else in the app changes.
 *
 * ── The Android problem, stated precisely ────────────────────────────────────
 * When the phone joins SIH-FIELD (or SIH-NODE-01), Android sees a network with
 * no internet and keeps the *default* route on mobile data. A plain
 * fetch('http://192.168.4.1:8080/...') therefore leaves over the cellular
 * interface and times out. The pod is up, the AP is up, the phone is
 * associated, and the request still fails.
 *
 * The symptom is indistinguishable from a dead server, which is why this costs
 * a day if it is hit cold. It is why `explainNetworkFailure` below exists: a
 * timeout against a link-local address gets named, not guessed at.
 *
 * ── The fix, and what it needs ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ConnectivityManager.requestNetwork() with a NetworkRequest specifying
 * TRANSPORT_WIFI and *without* NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET, then binding the
 * process (or the individual socket) to the Network handed back in the
 * callback. That is Java/Kotlin — it cannot be done from JS, and it cannot run
 * in Expo Go. It needs a small native module plus a config plugin, and an
 * `expo run:android` dev build.
 *
 * That module is not written yet. This file does not pretend otherwise: it
 * exposes the interface the rest of the app codes against, ships a no-op
 * implementation, and reports `bound: false` so the sync screen can say plainly
 * that the binding is unavailable rather than silently failing later.
 *
 * ── iOS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * iOS routes to the local subnet correctly on its own, but requires
 * NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription in Info.plist (set in app.json) and will
 * prompt the user the first time. Denied permission also surfaces as a
 * connection failure with no clear message, so it is named below too.
