 *
 * Three things are non-negotiable here and all three come from the registry:
 *
 *   advisory_only appears on every action, per-action rather than once at the
 *   bottom, so it cannot scroll out of view. Actuation was dropped from scope
 *   and the UI must not imply otherwise.
 *
 *   The verification badge renders from the structural enum, so switching to
 *   Hindi cannot drop it — which is the failure mode §1.2 exists to prevent.
 *
 *   A mandatory verification note (RECALLED_UNVERIFIED, or a status this build
 *   does not recognise) is always open, above the reasoning. Only the ordinary
 *   provenance notes fold behind "Why?".
