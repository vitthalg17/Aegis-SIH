/**
 * The sticky-trap block.
 *
 * ── The safety architecture this card has to make visible ───────────────────
 * TEMPLATE_ID_REGISTRY §4.3 sets up a deliberate split, and it is the most
 * carefully designed thing in the payload:
 *
 *   The gate on whether a farmer sprays is `total_blobs_counted` — a
 *   deterministic watershed segmentation of the card. Not the CNN. The CNN is
 *   a cross-domain European trap model, stamped RECALLED_UNVERIFIED, and it
 *   does not get a vote on chemical intervention.
 *
 *   That count therefore includes debris, non-target flies and glue residue,
 *   which makes it a conservative *over*-estimate against the threshold.
 *
 * The second half is the part a naive renderer drops, and dropping it is not
 * neutral: an over-estimate presented as a species count pushes a farmer toward
 * spraying. So the disclaimer travels with the number, from a constant, and the
 * morphological breakdown below it is labelled as the unverified guess it is.
 *
 * ── The most useful state on the card ───────────────────────────────────────
 * `NOT_SAMPLED_BY_STICKY_TRAP`. A yellow card does not catch stem borers —
 * those are monitored on pheromone lures — and it does not count planthoppers,
 * which are counted by tapping the base of a hill. A low number for either is
 * not a low number, it is a meaningless one. Rendering that as "0" would be the
 * system inventing a measurement, so it renders as advice about what to do
 * instead.
