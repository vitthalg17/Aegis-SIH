/**
 * Loads the shipped fixtures into the replica on first launch.
 *
 * The app must render a full history with no pod present — that had to work
 * before any networking did, and it matters more than usual right now, because
 * the SIH-FIELD access point is still waiting on a replacement WiFi dongle and
 * nobody has yet held this phone next to a live pod.
 *
 * Five of these six are invented, so they go in with origin 'fixture' and every
 * screen that shows one says SAMPLE DATA. They are chosen for their failure
 * states rather than their happy path, because degraded rendering is the part
 * that gets skipped when a demo is built happy-path-first — and on this system
 * the degraded states are not edge cases, they are Tuesday:
 *
 *   healthy          everything available: CWSI computed, satellite scene
 *                    cached, irrigation from the mast, trap under the limit
 *   failed-tier      bacterial leaf blight at 0.98 confidence on a class that
 *                    scores 0.00% recall on held-out cameras. The single most
 *                    important thing this UI has to render correctly
 *   recalled-dose    a RECALLED_UNVERIFIED sugarcane dose that must not render
 *                    like a registered one, plus a bare-soil scan where every
 *                    vegetation index is legitimately withheld
 *   trap-above-etl   over the published ETL, alongside a pest a sticky card is
 *                    the wrong instrument for and one with no published limit
 *   uncertain        the pod declining to call it, on the ONNX fallback engine
 *
 * The sixth is not invented. `advisory-device-capture.json` is the advisory the
 * hardware team captured from the Jetson Nano on 19 September, byte for byte.
 * It is here so the validator and every renderer are exercised against reality
 * rather than against our idea of it — it is the fixture that catches us
 * flagging a real advisory as broken, and it is the one that carries
 * MULTIPLE_CROPS_DETECTED, a `growth_stage.status` the contract's own enum does
 * not list, and an `irrigation` block of exactly two keys.
