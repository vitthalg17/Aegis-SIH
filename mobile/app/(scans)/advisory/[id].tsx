/**
 * One advisory, rendered entirely from the schema.
 *
 * The ordering is deliberate and is the argument this screen makes:
 *
 *   1. what you cannot trust about this record   origin, backend, violations
 *   1b. the walk report, for a walk from the app  summary, timeline, map, look-list
 *   2. the verdict, in one sentence              crop_health
 *   3. what to do                                actions, then the explanation
 *   4. the findings and how much they are worth  disease
 *   5. where they are                            detections, on a map
 *   6. the field readings                        water, vegetation, pest, season
 *   7. how it was collected                      inputs, scan
 *
 * Provenance before verdict, verdict before advice, advice before evidence.
 *
 * ── Why most of it is folded ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every card used to be open, and the screen ran to about eleven phone-heights
 * with the same caveats repeated on every finding. Sections 1 to 5 are what a
 * farmer acts on and stay open. Section 6 is a grid of weather-style tiles
 * and section 7 a card of one-line rows; both open on tap, so nothing was
 * removed. The relative-greenness band, which needs its caveat beside it, is
 * only shown once its tile is opened, where that caveat comes first.
